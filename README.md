## Abstract

We present **Story2Board**, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components: **Latent Panel Anchoring**, which preserves a shared character reference across panels, and **Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing (RAVM)**, which softly blends visual features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning, enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet consistent storyboards. We convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts with an off-the-shelf LLM, and evaluate on a new **Rich Storyboard Benchmark** that measures layout diversity, background-grounded storytelling, and consistency. Qualitative/quantitative results and a user study show that Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging storyboards than existing baselines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Platform Support
- ‚úÖ Officially supported: **Linux**, Python **3.12**, CUDA **12.x**
- üíª Windows / macOS: not officially tested, but you can try with the alternative requirements file: `requirements_all_platforms.txt`

We recommend a fresh Conda environment with Python 3.12.

---

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DavidDinkevich/Story2Board.git
cd Story2Board

# 2) Create and activate env
conda create -n story2board python=3.12
conda activate story2board

# 3) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Tip: If you want a specific CUDA build of PyTorch, install PyTorch first following the official instructions, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Quickstart

The entry point is `main.py`. The **required** arguments are:

- `--subject` ‚Äì the main subject (e.g., ‚Äúsmiling boy‚Äù).
- `--ref_panel_prompt` ‚Äì description of the **reference (top) panel**.
- `--panel_prompts` ‚Äì one or more prompts for the remaining panel(s).
- `--output_dir` ‚Äì where to save results.

Minimal skeleton:

```bash
python main.py   --subject "SUBJECT_NAME"   --ref_panel_prompt "REFERENCE_PANEL_TEXT"   --panel_prompts "PANEL_1_TEXT" "PANEL_2_TEXT" ...   --output_dir path/to/out
```

### Concrete example

```bash
python main.py   --subject "fox with shimmering fur and glowing eyes"   --ref_panel_prompt "stepping onto a mossy stone path under twilight trees"   --panel_prompts     "bounding across a fallen tree over a mist-covered ravine glowing faintly with constellations"     "perched atop a broken archway of ancient stone, vines and silver moss hanging down, the twilight sky glowing behind him"     "watching a meteor shower from the edge of a luminous lake that reflects the stars perfectly"   --output_dir outputs
```

This will generate a storyboard where the **top** panel is the reference, and each **bottom** panel reuses the same character identity while varying the scene/action.

---

## Outputs

- Generated images are written to `--output_dir`.  
- The constructed, per-panel prompts are logged for reproducibility.

---

## Method Overview (Very Brief)

- **Latent Panel Anchoring**: reuses a shared reference latent to stabilize identity across panels.  
- **RAVM (Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing)**: gently blends attention **values** between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention, preserving the model‚Äôs prior while improving cross-panel coherence.

---

## Changelog

- **21 Aug 2025**: Fixed missing line for **Latent Panel Anchoring (LPA)** in the released code (commit [34537e0](https://github.com/DavidDinkevich/Story2Board/commit/34537e02eac4e108fe1f8dae16e901d681af8887)).  
  - Restores expected behavior described in the paper.
